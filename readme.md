# This is a simple Podman setup script for the Gitea service

This script will initialize a podman pod with required containers to run your own
instance of the [Gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea) service.  

This script needs very little configuration - only really to congiure your desired ports (i.e. HTTP and SSH ports)  
Further configuration can be done via the gitea config file automatically generated by the container  

You will need to set up your own Reverse Proxy and TLS certificates
